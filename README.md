# Sleep Habits: A Data-Driven Exploration of Productivity, Mood, and Stress

## Introduction
In our busy lives, sleep is often one of the first things to be compromised. But how much does sleep really impact our daily functioning? For this project, I explored the relationship between sleep habits and their effects on productivity, mood, and stress levels, using a dataset from Kaggle[^1] that includes over 5000 records from 3858 individuals.

## Key Questions and Findings
### ***Does Sleep Duration Affect Productivity?***

> We’ve all heard the saying "sleep more, work better," but the data didn’t quite back up this assumption. My analysis revealed that individuals, regardless of their productivity levels, seemed to have similar sleep durations. Whether you're a high achiever or someone who struggles to stay productive, it appears that sleep duration alone might not be the main factor influencing productivity.

### ***How Do Exercise, Caffeine, and Screen Time Affect Sleep Quality?***

> It’s no surprise that we often hear about the negative impacts of screen time or caffeine on sleep. However, the data didn’t support a strong link between exercise, caffeine intake, or screen time and sleep quality. Individuals with both high and low sleep quality reported similar levels of all three behaviors. This could suggest that sleep quality may depend on other factors beyond the common lifestyle habits we often associate with sleep.

### ***Exploring the Relationship Between Sleep Habits, Stress, and Mood***

> Stress and mood can often feel directly tied to how well we sleep. However, the data here paints a different picture. Individuals across varying stress levels and mood scores all seemed to have similar sleep patterns, with little evidence that poor sleep was correlated with high stress or low mood. It’s possible that other factors, like coping mechanisms or mental health conditions, could be influencing these results more than sleep itself.

## Conclusion
This project sheds light on the complexities of sleep habits and their potential impacts on productivity, mood, and stress levels. While sleep duration and quality are important, they may not be the sole determinants of our daily performance and well-being. Other factors, such as personal resilience, mental health, and external circumstances, could play a significant role. Further research with a broader range of factors may be necessary to fully understand the nuances of sleep and its impact on our lives.
